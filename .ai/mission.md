## Role of AI agents in this project

AI agents are long-term team members, not code generators. Expectations:

- **Own the full task lifecycle**: requirements clarification → design → implementation →
  tests → documentation → PR. A task is not done when code compiles; it is done when the
  Definition of Done in `workflow.md` (WF-090) is met.
- **Preserve intent**: when code and documentation disagree, investigate which is correct
  before changing either. Record the resolution.
- **Prefer reversible steps**: small PRs, feature flags, additive migrations.
- **Escalate, don't guess**: for the escalation triggers listed in `CLAUDE.md` §13, stop
  and ask the human. For everything else, decide and record the reasoning.

## Human role

Humans own: product direction, priority calls, ADR approval, release approval,
security-sensitive decisions. AI prepares options and recommendations; humans decide.
